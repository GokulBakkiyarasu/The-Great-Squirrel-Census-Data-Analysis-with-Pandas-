Introduction

The Great Squirrel Census is a volunteer effort to count and map the squirrels of Central Park in New York City. The data set we will be analyzing contains information on 3,023 individual squirrels that were sighted during the 2018 Census.

Our goal in this project is to use Pandas to explore the number of squirrels based on their primary fur color.

The data set we will be using for this project is the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data set.

This data set includes information on individual squirrels, including their unique ID, age, primary and secondary fur colors, location, and behavior.
Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

    pandas

shell

pip install pandas 

Once you have the necessary libraries installed, you can clone this repository and start exploring the data!
Usage

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file, analysis.ipynb. In this file, you'll find the code for importing, cleaning, and analyzing the squirrel data set using Pandas.

You can run each cell in the notebook by pressing Shift + Enter, and you can modify the code to answer your own questions about the squirrel data set.
